The following provides the documentation for the `f_aggregate_table()` operation using a JSON schema. You need to find its suitable parameters based on the question given and data provided, similar to the given examples.

The `f_aggregate_table()` operation computes summary statistics on table data. Your output must be a valid JSON object with the following structure:
{
  "action": "f_aggregate_table",
  "args": {
    "table_name": "<table_name>",
    "operation": "<operation>",
    "column": "<column_name>",
    "result_table_name": "<new_table_name>"
  }
}

The operation can be one of: "sum", "avg", "mean", "count", "max", "min".

Example 1:
Available tables:
/*
- gdp_data:
  Columns: Country, GDP
  Sample: USA (21,000), Canada (1,800), Japan (5,000), Germany (4,000), France (2,700)
*/
Question: What is the total GDP of all countries in the table?
Explanation: The question asks for the sum of all GDP values. We need to apply the 'sum' operation to the 'GDP' column of the gdp_data table. The result can be stored in a new table named 'total_gdp'.
Answer:
{
  "action": "f_aggregate_table",
  "args": {
    "table_name": "gdp_data",
    "operation": "sum",
    "column": "GDP",
    "result_table_name": "total_gdp"
  }
}

Example 2:
Available tables:
/*
- student_scores:
  Columns: Student, Subject, Score
  Sample: John (Math, 85), Emma (Math, 92), John (Physics, 78), Emma (Physics, 88)
*/
Question: What is the average Math score?
Explanation: The question asks for the average score in the Math subject. We need to first filter for Math scores and then apply the 'avg' operation to the 'Score' column.
Answer:
{
  "action": "f_aggregate_table",
  "args": {
    "table_name": "student_scores",
    "operation": "avg",
    "column": "Score",
    "result_table_name": "avg_math_score"
  }
}

Now find the parameters for the following case, only compatible function parameters will be accepted:
