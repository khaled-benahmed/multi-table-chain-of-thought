The following provides the documentation for the `f_filter_table()` operation, which selects rows from a table that meet specific criteria. You need to find its suitable parameters based on the question given and data provided, similar to the given example:

Use f_filter_table(table_name, column, value) to keep only rows in a table where the specified column equals the given value.

Example:
/*
Available tables:
- country_data:
  Columns: Country, Continent, GDP
  Sample: USA (North America, 21,000), Canada (North America, 1,800), Japan (Asia, 5,000), Germany (Europe, 4,000), France (Europe, 2,700)
*/
Question: What is the total GDP of European countries?
Explanation: The question only concerns European countries. We need to filter the country_data table to keep only rows where the 'Continent' column equals 'Europe'. This removes non-European countries from consideration.
The answer is: f_filter_table('country_data', 'Continent', 'Europe')

/*
Available tables:
- employee_data:
  Columns: Employee, Department, Salary, Years of Service
  Sample: John (Sales, 75000, 5), Emma (Engineering, 95000, 3), Michael (Sales, 65000, 2), Sarah (Management, 110000, 8)
*/
Question: What is the average salary of employees in the Sales department?
Explanation: The question asks about employees in the Sales department only. We need to filter the employee_data table to keep only rows where the 'Department' column equals 'Sales'.
The answer is: f_filter_table('employee_data', 'Department', 'Sales')

Now find the parameters for the following case, only compatible function parameters will be accepted:
