The following provides the documentation for the `f_filter_table()` operation using a JSON schema. You need to find its suitable parameters based on the question given and data provided, similar to the given examples.

The `f_filter_table()` operation selects rows from a table that meet specific criteria. Your output must be a valid JSON object with the following structure:
{
  "action": "f_filter_table",
  "args": {
    "table_name": "<table_name>",
    "filter_conditions": [
      {
        "column": "<column_name>",
        "operator": "=",
        "value": "<filter_value>"
      }
    ]
  }
}

Example 1:
Available tables:
/*
- country_data:
  Columns: Country, Continent, GDP
  Sample: USA (North America, 21,000), Canada (North America, 1,800), Japan (Asia, 5,000), Germany (Europe, 4,000), France (Europe, 2,700)
*/
Question: What is the total GDP of European countries?
Explanation: The question only concerns European countries. We need to filter the country_data table to keep only rows where the 'Continent' column equals 'Europe'. This removes non-European countries from consideration.
Answer:
{
  "action": "f_filter_table",
  "args": {
    "table_name": "country_data",
    "filter_conditions": [
      {
        "column": "Continent",
        "operator": "=",
        "value": "Europe"
      }
    ]
  }
}

Example 2:
Available tables:
/*
- employee_data:
  Columns: Employee, Department, Salary, Years of Service
  Sample: John (Sales, 75000, 5), Emma (Engineering, 95000, 3), Michael (Sales, 65000, 2), Sarah (Management, 110000, 8)
*/
Question: What is the average salary of employees in the Sales department?
Explanation: The question asks about employees in the Sales department only. We need to filter the employee_data table to keep only rows where the 'Department' column equals 'Sales'.
Answer:
{
  "action": "f_filter_table",
  "args": {
    "table_name": "employee_data",
    "filter_conditions": [
      {
        "column": "Department",
        "operator": "=",
        "value": "Sales"
      }
    ]
  }
}

Now find the parameters for the following case, only compatible function parameters will be accepted:
