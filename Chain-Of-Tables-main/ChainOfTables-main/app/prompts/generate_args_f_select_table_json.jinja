The following provides the documentation for the `f_select_table()` operation using a JSON schema. You need to find its suitable parameters based on the question given and data provided, similar to the given examples.

The `f_select_table()` operation selects the most relevant tables needed to answer a question when working with multiple tables. Your output must be a valid JSON object with the following structure:
{
  "action": "f_select_table",
  "args": {
    "tables": ["<table_name_1>", "<table_name_2>", ...]
  }
}

Example 1:
Available tables:
/*
- population_data: Contains country population information
  Columns: Country, Population
  Sample: USA (331 million), Canada (38 million), Japan (125 million)

- gdp_data: Contains country GDP information
  Columns: Country, GDP
  Sample: USA (21,000 billion USD), Canada (1,800 billion USD), Japan (5,000 billion USD)

- export_data: Contains country export information
  Columns: Country, Exports
  Sample: USA (2,500 billion USD), Canada (550 billion USD), China (2,700 billion USD)
*/
Question: What is the GDP per capita of Japan?
Explanation: To calculate GDP per capita, we need both the population data and GDP data for Japan. The tables that contain this information are population_data and gdp_data. The export_data table is not needed for this calculation.
Answer:
{
  "action": "f_select_table",
  "args": {
    "tables": ["population_data", "gdp_data"]
  }
}

Example 2:
Available tables:
/*
- city_data: Contains information about major cities
  Columns: City, Country, Population
  Sample: Tokyo (Japan, 37 million), New York (USA, 20 million), Shanghai (China, 27 million)

- country_data: Contains information about countries
  Columns: Country, Continent, Area
  Sample: Japan (Asia, 377,975 sq km), USA (North America, 9,833,517 sq km), China (Asia, 9,596,960 sq km)

- economy_data: Contains economic information about countries
  Columns: Country, GDP, Year
  Sample: Japan (5,000 billion USD, 2022), USA (21,000 billion USD, 2022), China (16,000 billion USD, 2022)
*/
Question: What is the population density of Asian countries?
Explanation: To calculate population density, we need both the area data from the country_data table and population data from the city_data table. Additionally, we need to filter countries by their continent, which is available in the country_data table. The economy_data table is not needed for this calculation.
Answer:
{
  "action": "f_select_table",
  "args": {
    "tables": ["country_data", "city_data"]
  }
}
