The following provides the documentation for the `f_aggregate_table()` operation, which computes summary statistics on table data. You need to find its suitable parameters based on the question given and data provided, similar to the given example:

Use f_aggregate_table(table_name, operation, column, result_table_name) to perform aggregation operations like sum, average, count, max, or min on a specific column.

Example:
/*
Available tables:
- gdp_data:
  Columns: Country, GDP
  Sample: USA (21,000), Canada (1,800), Japan (5,000), Germany (4,000), France (2,700)
*/
Question: What is the total GDP of all countries in the table?
Explanation: The question asks for the sum of all GDP values. We need to apply the 'sum' operation to the 'GDP' column of the gdp_data table. The result can be stored in a new table named 'total_gdp'.
The answer is: f_aggregate_table('gdp_data', 'sum', 'GDP', 'total_gdp')

/*
Available tables:
- student_scores:
  Columns: Student, Subject, Score
  Sample: John (Math, 85), Emma (Math, 92), John (Physics, 78), Emma (Physics, 88)
*/
Question: What is the average Math score?
Explanation: The question asks for the average score in the Math subject. We need to first filter for Math scores and then apply the 'avg' operation to the 'Score' column.
The answer is: f_aggregate_table('student_scores', 'avg', 'Score', 'avg_math_score')

Now find the parameters for the following case, only compatible function parameters will be accepted:
