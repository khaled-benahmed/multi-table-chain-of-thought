The following provides the documentation for the `f_normalize_column()` operation, which standardizes column names across multiple tables. You need to find its suitable parameters based on the question given and data provided, similar to the given example:

Use f_normalize_column(target_name, [table1, column1], [table2, column2], ...) to standardize column names across different tables to ensure they can be properly joined or compared.

Example:
/*
Available tables:
- population_table:
  Columns: Nation, Population
  Sample: USA (331 million), Canada (38 million), Japan (125 million)

- economic_table:
  Columns: Country Name, GDP
  Sample: USA (21,000 billion USD), Canada (1,800 billion USD), Japan (5,000 billion USD)
*/
Question: Compare the GDP and population of Japan.
Explanation: To join these tables for comparison, we need to normalize the country name columns that have different names. In population_table, the column is called 'Nation', and in economic_table, it's called 'Country Name'. We need to standardize both to a common name like 'Country'.
The answer is: f_normalize_column("Country", ["population_table", "Nation"], ["economic_table", "Country Name"])

/*
Available tables:
- weather_data:
  Columns: City Name, Temperature, Humidity
  Sample: Tokyo (22°C, 65%), New York (18°C, 70%), London (15°C, 80%)

- tourism_stats:
  Columns: Location, Annual Visitors, Average Stay
  Sample: Tokyo (10 million, 4 days), New York (12 million, 5 days), London (8 million, 3 days)
*/
Question: What is the relationship between temperature and tourism in these cities?
Explanation: To analyze the relationship between temperature and tourism, we need to join the weather_data and tourism_stats tables. The city names are called 'City Name' in weather_data and 'Location' in tourism_stats. We need to standardize them to a common name.
The answer is: f_normalize_column("City", ["weather_data", "City Name"], ["tourism_stats", "Location"])

Now find the parameters for the following case, only compatible function parameters will be accepted:
