The following provides the documentation for the `f_group_by(columns)` operation, you need to find its suitable parameters similar to the given example: 

Use f_group_by() to count the values in a column.
Example:

row 2 : 2 | 5 | Olga Tereshkova (KAZ) | KAZ | 51.86 
row 3 : 3 | 4 | Pinki Pramanik (IND) | IND | 53.06 
row 4 : 4 | 1 | Tang Xiaoyin (CHN) | CHN | 53.66 
row 5 : 5 | 8 | Marina Maslyonko (KAZ) | KAZ | 53.99 
*/
Question: tell me the number of athletes from India.
The existing columns are: Rank, Lane, Athlete, Time, Country.
Explanation: The question asks about the number of athletes from India. Each row is about an athlete. We can group column "Country" to group the athletes from the same country.
Therefore, the answer is: f_group_by(["Country"]).

/*
col : district | name | party | residence | first served
row 1 : district 1 | nelson albano | dem | vineland | 2006
row 2 : district 1 | robert andrzejczak | dem | middle twp. | 2013â€
