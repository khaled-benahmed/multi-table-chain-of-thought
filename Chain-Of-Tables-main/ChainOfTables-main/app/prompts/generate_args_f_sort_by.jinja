To answer the question, we can first use f_sort_by() to sort the values in a column to get the order of the items. The order can be "descending" or "ascending".

The column to sort should have these data types:
1. Numerical: the numerical strings that can be used in sort
2. DateType: the strings that describe a date, such as year, month, day
3. String: other strings

/*
col : Position | Club | Played | Points | Wins | Draws | Losses | Goals for | Goals against
row 1 : 1 | Malaga CF | 42 | 79 | 22 | 13 | 7 | 72 | 47
row 10 : 10 | CP Merida | 42 | 59 | 15 | 14 | 13 | 48 | 41
row 3 : 3 | CD Numancia | 42 | 73 | 21 | 10 | 11 | 68 | 40
*/
Question: what club placed in the last position?
The existing columns are: Position, Club, Played, Points, Wins, Draws, Losses, Goals for, Goals against
Explanation: the question asks about the club in the last position. Each row is about a club. We need to know the order of position from last to front. There is a column for position and the column name is Position. The datatype is Numerical.
Therefore, the answer is: f_sort_by([["Position"], "descending"]).

/*
col : year | team | games | combined tackles | tackles | assisted tackles |
row 1 : 2004 | hou | 16 | 63 | 51 | 12 |
row 2 : 2005 | hou | 12 | 35 | 24 | 11 |
row 3 : 2006 | hou | 15 | 26 | 19 | 7 |
*/
Question: which year had the least amount of tackles?
The existing columns are: year, team, games, combined tackles, tackles, assisted tackles.
Explanation: the statement wants to check the least amount of tackles. Each row is about a year. We need to know the order of tackles from the least to the most. There is a column for tackles and the column name is tackles. The datatype is Numerical.
Therefore, the answer is: f_sort_by(["tackles"], "ascending").
